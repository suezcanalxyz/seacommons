"""Bounded episode builder (docs/fixes.md M5.2).

``coalesce_security_vessel_episodes()`` (core.live.vessel_episodes) used to
collapse every Live signal for one MMSI into a single, permanently-open
"episode" for the whole lifetime of that MMSI -- exactly the problem M5's
goal names: "stop equating one MMSI with one lifelong episode."

This module is the replacement logic, built and tested standalone against
the M5.2 exit gate: "two unrelated anomalies on the same MMSI days apart
become two episodes; repeated updates of one continuing event remain one
episode." Wired into ``coalesce_security_vessel_episodes()`` (docs/fixes.md
M14.2), which is now the authoritative live episode builder: it resolves
each signal's subject (core.mda.vessel_subject) and family (family_for()
below) and lets build_episodes() decide the grouping, then runs the same
rich per-episode aggregation (track, severity, source records) it always
did -- once per resulting episode instead of once per MMSI.

Episode boundary rules (docs/fixes.md M5.2), applied per (subject, family):

  - max time gap: a new episode starts once the gap since the family's last
    signal for this subject exceeds ``max_gap_s``;
  - spatial continuity: a new episode starts once consecutive signals are
    farther apart than ``max_spatial_nm`` (skipped when either signal has no
    position -- a missing coordinate is not evidence of discontinuity);
  - active hypothesis continuity: consecutive signals in the same family
    continue one episode regardless of exact anomaly sub-type (e.g. "gap"
    then "long_gap" is one continuing gap_episode, not two);
  - explicit resolution/reappearance: a signal carrying
    ``incident_lifecycle="resolved"`` closes the open episode for that
    (subject, family) -- the NEXT signal in that family, however soon,
    starts a new episode (a resolved incident reappearing is a new event,
    not a continuation of the one that just closed);
  - subject identity continuity: episodes are keyed by subject, never by
    raw MMSI alone -- see core.mda.vessel_subject (M5.1). A caller
    resolves subject_id before calling this; this module never inspects
    the MMSI itself.

A rendezvous/encounter signal can name two or more ``involved_subjects``;
such signals are grouped by the sorted tuple of every subject named across
the group's signals, not by a single subject -- "an episode can involve two
or more subjects for encounters" (M5.2).
