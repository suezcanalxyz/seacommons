"""Twikit X monitor — account-focused public-tweet ingestion via a real session.

Twikit talks to X's public web/GraphQL endpoints using cookies exported from the
account's browser. Unlike the paid official API, this is free, but it *is*
account-emulation: it must be treated as the least-trusted X source.

Scope (per operator directive): track a curated list of *specific* accounts
(NGO SAR monitors such as @alarm_phone), NOT generic keyword searches.
Polling is tiered, not always-on: each sweep only fetches accounts whose poll
interval has elapsed. Priority accounts (default @alarm_phone) are polled
every ~45 s for near-real-time pickup, the rest every ~5 min. A Telegram
notification is fired when any tracked account posts.

X offers no push notification for "another account posted" (the paid official
Streaming API is enterprise-only and twikit's own streaming only covers your
own tweet engagement/DMs), so some polling is unavoidable — the X web app
itself polls roughly every 30 s. The tiered scheduler below keeps that cost
minimal.

Ingestion semantics ("strong distress parsing"): a tweet is tagged as distress
only when it is an actionable direct distress/SAR call (is_direct_distress_call
— the same strict signal the Alarm Phone monitor uses), never for resolved or
contextual posts. Non-distress posts from tracked accounts are still ingested
    but tagged `report_kind="news"` (or `"resolved"`), so the operational/distress
    feed is never polluted by commentary.

Repost semantics (operator directive): a repost (retweeted_tweet) of an alert
that already opened an incident must answer that SAME thread — it is recorded
onto the parent incident's `thread_reposts` bookkeeping and never spawns a new
marker, never bumps a version, and never re-broadcasts an update. Only if the
original was never tracked is the original content ingested (deduplicated by
tweet id), so nothing is lost.

Quote-tweet semantics: a quote tweet of an already-tracked incident is
threaded the same way as a plain repost (no new marker, no re-broadcast), but
— unlike a plain RT — the quoting account's own caption is new content (e.g.
"confirmed rescued"), so it is kept as a `note` on the thread record instead
of being discarded. When the quoted tweet is NOT already tracked, its text
and media are merged with the quoting account's caption for distress/geo
extraction: Alarm Phone and other tracked NGOs sometimes quote a source (a
witness, a partner NGO) with only a short caption of their own, and the real
distress content — including the map screenshot with GPS coordinates — lives
in the quoted tweet, not the caption. Losing that would mean losing the
signal entirely.

Session resilience: a transient failure while establishing the twikit session
(e.g. a network blip at process start) retries with the same capped backoff
used for poll errors, rather than permanently killing the monitor until the
next process restart. If every tracked account fails to poll for several
consecutive cycles — a strong signal the session itself has gone stale, not
that every account broke independently — the client is rebuilt from the same
cookies file on the next cycle.


Security posture (must be preserved):
  * Strictly opt-in: `TWIKIT_ENABLED=true` AND `TWIKIT_COOKIES_FILE` must point
    at an existing file, otherwise the monitor stays dormant.
  * Cookies live on disk (0600, owned by the service user) or in a secrets
    manager — never in the repo, never in logs. Cookie contents are never logged.
  * Read-only: only profile/timeline reads are called. No follow/like/retweet/
    DM/block calls, ever. Exponential backoff on rate limits (cap 15 min)
    protects the real account from aggressive polling.
  * Every event is labelled `source_policy="unofficial"` — EXCEPT confirmed
    distress calls from these specific tracked accounts, which the operator
    has explicitly chosen to surface on the public live map
    (`publication_status="published"`, `source_policy="operator_published"`).
    Non-distress news from the same accounts stays operator-only and never
    feeds the public map or distress triangulation.

        tweet ("Rescued to #Lampedusa! ...") never appears via
        user.get_tweets("Tweets"/"Replies", ...) at the top level — X
        excludes it from both. It DOES appear nested under the original
        tweet's own `.replies`, but only when that tweet is reached via the
        account's own timeline: X groups a tweet together with the author's
        own reply-thread as a single "profile-conversation" module there,
        and twikit exposes it as a plain, already-complete list.

        get_tweet_by_id(...).replies looked like an equivalent shortcut (one
        fetch per event, no full timeline scan) but isn't: verified live
        against a real 3-reply thread (self, stranger, self) that its cursor
        cuts off after 2 replies and never surfaces the 3rd via `.next()` —
        silently dropping the actual resolution reply. The timeline path
        does not have this gap, so re-walking each tracked account's recent
        timeline (already fetched every poll anyway) is used instead.

        Threads EVERY reply on the tracked tweet, not just same-author ones
        (explicit user follow-up: "i reply sono agli stessi tweet quindi
        vanno ricontrollati ogni tot" -- a real-time cross-account reply is
        already caught in _ingest()/_thread_reply(), but a case can stay
        "active" for days and a cross-account reply arriving on an
        already-processed old tweet needs this periodic re-walk to ever be
        seen at all, same as a delayed self-reply). Correlated evidence, not
        confirmation either way -- see _thread_own_replies.

        Also self-audits: any still-unresolved candidate whose own tweet
        does not turn up in its account's fetched timeline — old enough that
        it should have, if the tweet were still reachable — likely means the
        tweet was deleted with no matching repost (so the ingestion-side
        dead-link fix never had anything to latch onto). That case can't be
        auto-healed here, so it's surfaced instead of silently sitting wrong
