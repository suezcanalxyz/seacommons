"""InvestigationHypothesis lifecycle engine (docs/fixes.md M6).

**Goal:** make Maritime Intelligence a real investigative workflow instead
of a detector feed. A hypothesis stores reason codes and counter-indicators,
not a black-box risk number, and moves through an explicit lifecycle:

    candidate -> collecting -> review_ready -> assessed -> published
              -> rejected
              -> expired

Every transition is recorded in ``audit_history`` (actor, timestamp,
old/new state, a hash of the evidence snapshot at that moment) -- never a
silent state change.

Exit gate: "no single raw AIS observation can create a published
Intelligence allegation." Enforced structurally, not by convention: the
state machine requires passing through collecting and review_ready before
assessed (no shortcut transitions), ``can_publish()`` requires
non-empty ``reason_codes`` AND non-empty ``evidence_links`` (plural), and
every one of the six gate functions below independently demands at least
two distinct pieces of corroborating evidence before a hypothesis is even
eligible to progress -- matching the spec's own wording for every gate
("X requires Y *plus* independent Z").

This module is pure and standalone: it holds no reference to
core.intel.store/IntelEventDB, core.mda.vessel_subject, or any live
detector. A caller assembles the gate-function inputs from whatever
evidence sources it has (SourceObservation, VesselSubject, episode
builder output, ...); wiring this into an actual ingestion/investigation
pipeline is a separate, later PR.
