"""Public Maritime Intelligence projection for InvestigationHypothesis
(docs/fixes.md M14.4).

core.intel.publication_policy.project_public_maritime_assessed() is the
sole authority for what leaves this module: it independently re-verifies
core.intel.hypothesis.can_publish() itself (docs/fixes.md M14.4: "Maritime
Intelligence public output must require the hypothesis publication
gate"), so nothing here duplicates that decision -- a hypothesis is never
shaped for public output on any other basis.
