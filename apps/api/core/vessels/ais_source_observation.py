"""SourceObservation sampling for the live AIS feed (docs/fixes.md M1.2).

AISStream's PositionReport firehose fires on every fix -- many messages
per second across the tracked bbox. Recording a SourceObservation per fix
would flood the table without adding evidence value (a position report
5 seconds after the last one is not new information; core.vessels.
track_store already keeps the throttled trajectory history that actually
needs that density). This subscribes to the same shared hook every other
AIS consumer uses (core.vessels.aisstream.register_position_hook) and
records one only when something actually changed for that vessel:

  - its navigational status changed since the last recorded observation
    (observation_type=ais_nav_status);
  - or it is reporting again after a silence of at least
    AIS_SOURCE_OBSERVATION_GAP_S since its last recorded observation
    (observation_type=ais_gap -- the reappearance itself is the
    observation-worthy event, not every fix in between).

v0 scope: service=maritime/lane=safety is used for every sampled
observation here, not only nav_status in {2, 3, 6} (not_under_command /
restricted_manoeuvrability / aground). A raw navigational-status change is
closer in spirit to vessel operational/safety context than to Maritime
Intelligence or Environmental, the other two available lanes -- but this
is a coarse default, not a claim that every transition is safety-critical.
A later classification pass (once more of docs/fixes.md's evidence model
exists) can assign a more specific lane per nav_status value.

Best-effort and strictly additive: never touches core.vessels.registry
(latest position) or core.vessels.track_store (trajectory history); both
keep functioning exactly as before regardless of this module.
