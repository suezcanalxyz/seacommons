            PostgreSQL is the durable system of record. Live and Play read public projections of
            that record; they do not run separate investigative logic. Edge and browser snapshots
            can keep the interface available, but they are caches, not a second truth.

              SeaCommons is designed so a reader can move backwards from a public case to the
              observations, transformations and uncertainties that produced it. If that chain is
              missing, the result should not be presented as well established.
