# SeaCommons documentation

This index distinguishes canonical design documents from operational runbooks,
historical evidence and forward-looking plans. Start here instead of choosing
the newest dated filename.

## Canonical design

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) — deployable surfaces, process topologies,
  storage ownership and invariants.
- [Data flow](DATA_FLOW.md) — ingestion, persistence, projection, Public Live and
  drift flows.
- [Security model](SECURITY_MODEL.md) — trust boundaries, authentication,
  webhook authenticity and public/private policy.
- [Realtime architecture](REALTIME_ARCHITECTURE.md) — delivery semantics,
  ordering, fallbacks and recovery.
- [Testing strategy](TESTING.md) — the testing pyramid and the map from the ten
  highest-risk flows to the tests that guard them.
- [Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md) — deployment modes, required production
  configuration, rollout and rollback order.
- [Development](DEVELOPMENT.md) — local setup, the dev stack, test/lint commands
  and common contributor tasks.
- [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) — environment variables grouped by concern,
  production requirements and combination validation.
- [AI-assisted engineering policy](AI_ENGINEERING_POLICY.md) — rules for changes
  developed with AI coding tools.
- [Contract catalogue](contracts/README.md) — versioned machine-readable
  payload contracts.
- [Architecture decisions](adr/README.md) — durable decisions and trade-offs.

These documents describe current intended behavior. If a dated audit conflicts
with them, the canonical documents and executable tests take precedence.

## Operational runbooks

- [Production runbook](PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md)
- [Pilot runbook](PILOT_RUNBOOK.md)
- [Federated Live runbook](FEDERATED_LIVE_RUNBOOK.md)
- [Cloudflare edge deployment](CLOUDFLARE_EDGE_DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [Oracle deployment](DEPLOY_CLOUDFLARE_ORACLE.md)
- [Live cutover and rollback](LIVE_FIRST_CUTOVER.md)

Runbooks contain procedures and environment-specific commands. Validate them
against the current deployment manifests before use; a runbook is not the
architecture source of truth.

## Historical audits and evidence

The following files are retained for traceability. They are point-in-time
observations and are superseded as architecture descriptions by the canonical
documents above:

- `DOMAIN_FTP_AUDIT_2026-07-15.md`
- `ORACLE_MIGRATION_AUDIT_2026-07-15.md`
- `PRODUCTION_AUDIT_2026-07-15.md`
- `RESEARCH_AUDIT_2026-07-15.md`
- `LIVE_AUDIT_2026-08-24.md`
- `ENGINEERING_AUDIT.md`

`ENGINEERING_AUDIT.md` holds the baseline audit. [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) is
the production-hardening plan built on that audit, with a progress log tracking
the state of each item. The canonical documents above reflect the resulting
architecture.

## Plans and research proposals

Files such as `SIMULATION_DEMO_PLAN.md`, `UNREAL_PIXEL_STREAMING_PLAN.md`,
`VESSEL_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`, `UI_MOBILE_REDESIGN.md` and `PILOT_PHASE0.md`
describe proposed or staged work. They are not claims that functionality is
deployed.
